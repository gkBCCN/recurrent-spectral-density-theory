# recurrent-spectral-density-theory
Theory for spectral densities of recurrent spiking network outputs: all-spike, activity, and synchrony.

First select a J value (0 or 0.01) in param_file.py.

Then calculate all necessary spectral densities of interest using main.py

Three plots from the paper (Figures 3-5) can be generated by running their designated scripts.  The simulation data used in the paper has been provided for both J values for all three plots.
