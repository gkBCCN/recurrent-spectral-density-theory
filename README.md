<b>theory.py</b> provides the code to find the analytical results for the spectral densities of recurrent spiking network outputs: all-spike, activity, and synchrony.

#### Instructions
Select a J value (0 or 0.01) in <b>param_file.py</b>.

Calculate all necessary spectral densities of interest by setting the flags at the beginning of <b>main.py</b> before running it.

Three plots from the paper (Figures 3-5) can be generated by running their designated scripts.  The simulation data used in the paper has been provided for both J values for all three plots.
